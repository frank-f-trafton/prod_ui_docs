# Widgets

Widgets are the programmable objects that make up an interface.

Most widgets fall under one of the following broad categories:

* Controls, like buttons and sliders

* Containers (of other widgets)

* Informational or cosmetic elements, like this text


## Root Widget

The root is an invisible container that holds all other widgets. Only one root is allowed in the UI Context.


## G2 Widgets

G2 (second generation) widgets are direct children of the root.
